# Numerical-Method
Numerical methods are a branch of mathematics that focuses on the development and application of algorithms to solve mathematical problems numerically, especially those that cannot be solved analytically. These methods are used in various fields of science and engineering to approximate the solutions of differential equations, integrals, systems of linear equations, interpolation, and optimization. With a discrete computation-based approach, numerical methods allow solving complex problems using computers, such as the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots, the finite difference method for numerical derivatives, and the finite element method in physical simulations. Efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the solution are the main factors in choosing the appropriate numerical method for a problem.
